Biden’s entire candidacy, so far, seems to be an effort to save what’s left of Obama’s legacy.
Molly Prince reports at the Daily Caller:Biden Vows To Reinstate Obamacare’s Individual Mandate Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden revealed Friday he would reinstate the individual mandate and penalize Americans who do not obtain health care coverage if he were to win the presidency.
Biden put forth that as a way to guarantee that all Americans receive health care coverage, the federal government would fine any individual who did not obtain sufficient health insurance… “Yes, yes, I’d bring back the individual mandate,” Biden replied when Cuomo inquired further about the unpopular penalty.
“We’re in a situation where if you provide an option for anybody who in fact wants to buy into Medicare for All, they can buy in,” Biden said.",0.2972091248869593,0.14292737686045495

Attorneys for the state of Texas argue the health law cannot stand since the Republican-led Congress in 2017 zeroed out Obamacare’s individual mandate — a penalty imposed on people who chose to remain uninsured.
Democrats had favored the penalty as a way to induce more people to purchase health insurance, with the goal of reaching near-universal coverage.
